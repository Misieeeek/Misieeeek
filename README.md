## Hi there 👋👋

My name is Pawel, and I’m currently pursuing a degree in Geospatial Computer Science at AGH University of Krakow.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I'm currently developing a project called Algorithm Visualizer. As the name implies, it brings algorithms to life through visualizations.
- ⚡ Future plans: I'm planning to make an application that will use different learning strategies/techniques and an application to determine the trajectory of a vehicle in real or near-real time.
